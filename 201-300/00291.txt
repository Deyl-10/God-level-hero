Chapter 291: Normal Players Have Good Stuff Too

Da Fei left the ranger guild and went to the barracks in the city to see how many recruitment slots the mayor had opened up for him. This time, the mayor gave him five Second Lieutenant ranks, allowing Da Fei's four sub-heroes to be promoted. His Command Power suddenly increased by 400, instantly solving the problem of military strength.

However, there was still an even bigger problem, the problem of tactical positions! Da Fei only had four tactical positions at Level 37. He could recruit four sub-heroes, and he could only bring four troops. Fortunately, Deirdre's Rocket Style upgraded to Level 40, so she had five tactical positions. This way, she could provide one more tactical position for the commander, so Da Fei could bring five troops in total. However, compared to the troops that Da Fei had mixed up with, five tactical positions were very tight.

Currently, Da Fei could fight with 200 Forest Goddess, 50 Druids, and more than 100 Banshee, which took up 3 tactical slots. Then, would the Lich Dragon fight? Was it worth it for a Level 8 soldier to take up a precious tactical slot?

Then, was this Storm Druid the same as an ordinary Druid? From the situation in the previous competition, the Succubus Emperor, the Cannon Emperor, and the Banshee were all the same type of soldiers that the system had tacitly approved of. Then, this Druid must be the same, right? If not, or was it a question from the higher-ups, was it worth it for five Level 7 Storm Druids to occupy a tactical position? And to know if it was worth it, the key was how many soldiers the mayor had given him. If he could make up a whole team of Level 3 Forest Hunters, then there was no need to hesitate. In the current game stage, numbers would absolutely crush everything!

Da Fei arrived at the military camp in the city. It was bustling with activity. Countless players were peddling on the streets around the military camp. This was the most prosperous area in the city.

"500 gold coins for a Forest Hunter. I'll buy as many as I can! I'll sell them directly!"

"Ancient Tomb Warrior's Sword. C-rank Strategy Treasure. + 2 Attack, + 2 Defense. The price I want is too low to return!"

"Selling the hidden Skill Book of Ore Exploration. I want a message!"

"Blueheart Grass, 1 unit 300 gold coins!"

"Sales for Level 1 Weapon Sword Dancer. Hurry up if you want to buy it. It will only last for half an hour!"

"Thorn Island, form a team. Strong meat shield, lead the team. Level 30 and above, lead 300 full troops!"

Looking at the bustling streets, Da Fei's heart couldn't help but skip a beat. He had just been anemic, so shouldn't he accept a set of Blood equipment? Oh right, didn't Heavenly Sword Eastern Sword give him a set of Unity Equipment as a greeting gift? He was still missing two pieces. Would he be able to collect them? Also, it was probably time to sell his sub-quality Life-Steal Heritage, right? However, it was best to find a big guild for this kind of transaction. It was impossible for ordinary players to produce good items from street stalls. In short, after he was done with his work, he would contact Star's Goddess, Dragon Slayer Boss Ma.

Da Fei's appearance naturally caused a sensation in the entire street. All kinds of "Brother Fei, do you want xxx?" "Brother Fei, buy some new xxxes!" This made Da Fei sigh again at the distress of being a celebrity. He couldn't even stop shopping.

Da Fei squeezed to the front of the barracks. The recruitment officer of the barracks said, "So it's Mr. Da Fei. The mayor has ordered that Mr. Da Fei can recruit 1, 2, and 3 level troops with a Presidential Rate of up to 500 points. However, these troops must have the escort rank of the Chamber of Commerce before they can be recruited. Furthermore, they must have the mission entrusted by the Dragon Rider Chamber of Commerce before they can go out to battle. If these troops have any losses, you can come here and continue to replenish them. However, you have to lose corresponding Reputation according to the losses of the troops. Please be careful in your deployment!"

It turned out that it was all filled up according to the number of units. There was no limit to the number of per week! Mayor, you're really interesting! What else can I say? I now have four Second Lieutenant ranks and 400 Jungle Hunters. I'll recruit 200 Jungle Hunters! For the elves, even if they don't know what kind of soldiers to use, recruiting Jungle Hunters will definitely not go wrong. Then, the four main positions for this competition can be decided. Forest Goddess, Banshee, Druid, Jungle Hunters! Wahahaha, all long-range troops, flying and long-range troops. I still have to do some maneuvering. I'll shoot wherever I want!

Recruit! Brother, I have money, wahahaha!

Da Fei opened the army camp menu. At that instant, Da Fei sucked in a cold breath! Da Fei rubbed his eyes to confirm if he had seen wrongly? He had not seen wrongly! The third elite form of the army was now available to Da Fei!

Arcane Archer: Elite form of a level 3 Elven unit. Attack: 8, Defense: 6, Health: 21, Damage: 69, Attack Speed: 13, Movement Speed: 13, Command Value: 2, Recruitment Price: 547 Gold Coins. Special Skill: Long-range Shooting, Piercing, Repulse, Precise Shooting, Arrows Formation!

This was the elite form of a Level 3 Elven soldier! It was known as the Human-shaped Ballista, the Mage Killer, and the Secret Archers that could destroy enemies 100 steps away! Under normal circumstances, only NPCs could use this unit!

Compared to the Jungle Hunters, the Secret Archers each had an additional point in attack and defense damage, but their health had indeed increased from 14 HP to 21 HP, greatly enhancing the survival ability of the troops. Although they had sacrificed the ability to fire two consecutive shots, their long range was enough to give the other shooters a head-on blow. In addition, their high-speed movement ability, coupled with the high-speed movements of the ranger heroes, could completely kill their opponents with guerrilla warfare! This was the absolute trump card of the elves, the Secret Archers!

And now, this unit that was so powerful that it affected the balance of the game had fallen into the hands of Da Fei, a player with the Godly Luck Skill! Once Da Fei obtained one Skill Point and learned the Godly Luck Skill sub-skill, the chance of the Secret Archers' "Retreat" special skill appearing would increase by 10%. Once the number of Secret Archers was formed, he could totally defeat his opponents in close combat without getting close, right?

What the f*ck, is this the level 1, 2, and 3 Regular Troops that the mayor casually mentioned? This should be a phase reward for an Epic-ranked merchant association mission, right? It has to be, it has to be! Even my Pond of Light kindergarten Epic mission reward rare soldiers like the Forest Goddess. It's natural for the merchant association to revive and resist the Sea God's Curse to recruit some elite soldiers!

< System Notification: You spent 109,400 gold coins to recruit 200 Secret Archers. This unit is temporarily unable to join your unit and is stored in the barracks. >

Da Fei laughed excitedly. If such a unit could not become a world champion even if they participated in the competition, he could only use it to thank the world! However, there was a problem. This unit was limited by the mission. Would the competition system allow them to participate? What if they could not participate?

Oh right, it seemed like there was a player on the street who kept collecting Forest Hunters. Could he double or even double the price to collect more soldiers from him? Not to mention double the price, Forest Hunters, which produced very little, could be used as currency for Elf players during the open beta!

At this moment, Da Fei heard a low voice from behind him. "Da Fei, do you want to see the top quality goods?"

Although the voice behind him was not loud, it was extremely ear-piercing in the street full of shouting. This was because he was actually not called "Brother Fei" but "Da Fei". This made Da Fei very uncomfortable. Da Fei could not help but turn around and see a Dwarf player named "Thunder Shocks the Heavens". He was dressed in wind-refined steel armor.

Da Fei couldn't help but think highly of this eye-catching equipment. Could it be a player who was forging and selling armor? He was just thinking of replacing this pirate skin! However, the name Earthshaking Lightning sounded a little familiar. He had seen it before?

Dafei asked, "Top quality good stuff?"

Earthshaking Thunder said proudly, "I'll show you the goods!"

Then, a trading box popped up, and a dazzling silver spear appeared in the trading column!

Titan's Grip: God-grade weapon, long spear, personal attack + 10, personal damage + 10, Health + 100. When it hits an enemy, there is an additional lightning paralysis and speed reduction effect. There is a chance for a knockout effect. Quest item.

God-grade equipment! Spear! In that instant, Da Fei's eyes popped out!

There were two types of treasures. One was a strategic treasure, which enhanced the strength of the entire army; the other was personal equipment, which only enhanced the strength of the hero himself. The player's equipment column had two positions: strategic equipment and personal equipment. Strategic equipment did not have any class restrictions, and anyone could use it. For example, Da Fei's personal occupation was a Pikeman who could only use a Pike, but Da Fei's strategic weapon position was the Captain's Sword. The attributes of these two sets of equipment did not interfere with each other, and high attributes covered low attributes.

This God-grade weapon was obviously a personal equipment, and it happened to be something that Da Fei, this Pikeman, could use! To Da Fei, who had not personally taken action for many years, personal equipment did not matter. However, to Da Fei, who had just gotten a hold of his uncle, this gun actually increased his health by 100. It was too attractive! Da Fei could not help but be tempted!

However, this gun was a mission item? What was going on? However, at the current stage, divine weapons could only fall into the hands of normal players in the form of "mission items", right? Unexpectedly, ordinary players actually had good items in their hands! There were really hidden dragons and crouching tigers in the China server!

Da Fei looked up and asked, "How much?"

Earthshaking Big Thunder said arrogantly, "I want to exchange goods. I heard that you killed a Demigod and dropped a divine artifact. You also brought back three ships of rare goods. Let me see your goods!"

What the f*ck! Look at the goods? Are you kidding me? I'm about to go to the competition. How can you look at my divine weapon? Is it a military secret or national secret? Who knows if you're selling it for real or not? Or are you trying to get information from me?

Da Fei said calmly, "Sorry, it's not convenient for me to take out my divine weapon. I can buy it with gold coins."

Earthshaking Thunder laughed loudly and said, "Buy it with gold coins? What use do I have for something that is spawned every day in this studio? You are the number one player in the China server, the number one amateur player in the world, an awesome player that is even more impressive than the big guilds. You can't even bring out the goods? Then why would I teleport all the way out to find you!"

At that moment, all the players on the street looked over!

Da Fei flew into a rage! Da Fei was now a famous person. Once he became famous, he would put on airs and naturally lose his temper. More importantly, fame would be Da Fei's business capital in the future! How could he allow others to undermine him?

Are you f*cking looking for trouble? Do you really think I don't have a God-grade weapon? Fine, I happen to have a God-grade weapon that I'm considering whether to get rid of, so I'll take this opportunity to advertise! However, even if my God-grade weapon is f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cked up, do you really think I don't have a God-grade weapon? Fine, I just happen to have a f*cking God-grade weapon that I'm considering whether to get rid of, so I'll take this opportunity to advertise! However, even if my God-grade weapon is f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f*cking f * c
