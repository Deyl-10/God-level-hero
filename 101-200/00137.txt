Chapter 137: Killing In The Mist

Junwen

The blurry figure of the sailboat didn't attract the attention of the excited competitors from the various countries. After all, the underground world was dim to begin with. As the pursuing fleets from the various countries approached their target, they suddenly discovered that their vision was getting darker. When they suddenly realized that they were in a fog, the entire world suddenly turned dark!

The sudden change shook the command centers of the various countries!

Captain America spat out a mouthful of beer. The Indian's applause came to an abrupt stop. He himself was stunned! All the professional players knew that this was definitely not a natural phenomenon in the game! This was a technique from the Chinese! How much support did he get from the NPCs?

— Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! The sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the sounds of the ballista from the ballista from the ballista! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! In the ballista from the ballista from the ballista! In the ballista! In the ballista! In the ballista!

— Team channel: Indian player Lashjam was attacked by the enemy faction player Da Fei! Player Lashjam was killed! Player Lashjam's troops were defeated!

The command center of the three countries exploded! Such a disadvantage left the multinational forces at a loss.

"Sir! What should we do?"

On the battlefield, a commander had to be responsible for the lives of his soldiers. Of course, according to the rules of the US military, soldiers could disobey unreliable orders and fight with their commander in the military court. But in the game, Howell had no such worries.

If failure was unavoidable, then let’s fight to the death! Since the opponent was as strong as an alien, Captain Merika did not feel burdened.

Howell issued his final command. "Find him! Attack him! Destroy him!"

"Yes, Sir!"

In the fog, the warships of the various countries charged around like headless flies. The fireballs of the Lord of Abyss roared and flashed red in the darkness. The effect of the fireballs was to turn the black fog into red fog, but it was still useless.

"Found it! Coordinates (2427, 112)!” An excited and wild roar came from the darkness!

"We're all here (2427, 112)! Can you not give us the coordinates?"

"Sh * t! Don't come over, it's fake! It's the Illusionary Legion's magic!"

Another ballista shot out from the darkness!

— Team channel: Today, this player, Mad God Shinozaki, was attacked by the opposing faction's player, Da Fei! Player Mad God Shinozaki was killed! Player Mad God Shinozaki's troops were defeated!

— Team channel: Indian player Sanjani was attacked by the enemy faction player Da Fei! Player Sanjani was killed! Player Sanjani's troops were defeated!

Exterminate two armies at the same time! The command centers of the various kingdoms exploded once again! Everyone was deeply aware that the rapidly mass-producing workshops of the Hell of Consciousness were a product of an era when compared to these stone-age oarsmen and cannons that seemed to be equipped with magic power! This was especially so for the Americans who were used to using technology that was several eras higher than theirs to crush their opponents. The difference in equipment was simply unbearable! Was this what a leader of a kingdom said about being beaten after falling behind? This feeling was truly terrible.

— Boom! Another bolt of lightning struck the ground!

— Team channel: Merika player Jerry was attacked by the opposing faction player Da Fei! Player Jerry was killed! Player Jerry's troops were defeated!

In a short period of time, three troops were defeated!

After a series of shocking incidents, the command centers of the various countries were already stupefied. Facing an alien with future technology in the game, what else could Earthlings do? This was a game, not Hollywood. Even Americans were not a match for future warriors.

That's right! At this moment, Da Fei was acting as a future warrior. The 32 cannons on SV Fly were all open, firing from both sides!

The 44 rampaging warships did not allow Da Fei to hold back at all. He would destroy anything he encountered! Who could stop the simultaneous firing of the Flying Cross with 16 ballistae on the side of SV Fly? This was the best and most satisfying attack Da Fei had received since he got SV Fly!

Although the world in front of Da Fei was pitch black in the eyes of the multinational alliance, it was also pitch black in his eyes. However, there were many red dots on the radar of the small map!

That's right, I'm playing the legendary Map Cannon! The world in the eyes of God-grade players is obviously different from the world in the eyes of mortal players. Haha! Wahahaha! As for the simulated Stealth Sailing Skill? Needless to say, it obviously failed! How can God-grade skills be copied so easily?

But it didn't matter. If the simulation failed, the fog would still be there! In fact, the fog would always be there! And the deceptive illusion army would always be there too, because the old lady was having fun too! Awesome! It was always so awesome! Wahahaha!

(— Illusionary Legion: Using magic to project the image of a troop. The image can move and attack, but there is no harm done. Once attacked, it will disappear. At the same time, the image has the characteristic of Void Body Evasion.)

The bombardment continued. Was this a crushing defeat? No! The American player, SawSaw, wanted to defend the dignity of the American team! In fact, SawSaw, this great demon, this warrior who could only appear in the future, became the only hope to save the American team! Of course, he was also the only hope for this operation to turn the tables. All the members were doing their best to find the target and create an opportunity for SawSaw to teleport the decapitation hero.

A fireball shot by the Abyssal Lord exploded. In the flames, the outline of the huge sailing ship appeared before their eyes! More than ten crossbow bolts shot out from one of its cannons!

"It's here!" The entire Hell Bar shouted in unison.

In that instant, SawSaw, who had been accumulating his strength for a long time, flashed and appeared on the deck of the sailing ship—then the soles of his feet disappeared and his body fell. Eh?

"Sh * tcuk—" With a splash, the Great Evil Demon fell into the pool of light with a loud scream. It was as if it had fallen into a pool of acid, and its entire body erupted with thick white smoke before turning into a white light and dying.

So that ship was an army illusion! For a moment, the entire Hell Bar was silent. Then—someone took the lead and burst into laughter.

SawSaw looked at everyone with a pale face. Howell coughed and patted his shoulder. "Okay! That's it, that's it! You did well!"

"My failure is America's failure, America's failure is justice's failure! Shit!"

Everyone laughed.

Howell opened the bottle and shouted, “Come, for the failure of justice, cheers!”

"Wahahaha, cheers!"

Compared to the calmness of the American team leader's family, the Indian command center was silent and solemn. No one spoke. The only thing they could do was listen to the sound of the Ballista in the dark and wait for the battle to end.
