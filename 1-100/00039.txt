Chapter 39: Beautiful Pirate Hero

Shumilouco

Da Fei got up from the ground with a dirty face.

What the heck! What was happening? He was safe for now, and the ship was safe too. It seemed like the game was a game after all. He wouldn't touch players' virtual property so easily. He'd go to the shipyard first. They had taken his ship to the shipyard. As long as he fixed the ship, he could find a way to escape. Of course, it wouldn't be easy.

Da Fei looked around as he walked toward the shipyard. The residents of this town all had hostile red names in Da Fei's eyes. They all looked at him as if he was a cat or a mouse. Da Fei felt scared.

Da Fei went to the factory. A dozen tattooed and scarred workers were drinking and playing cards.

Da Fei found someone who looked like the leader and asked, "How much does fixing my ship cost?"

Everyone laughed. "Your boat? Who do you think you are? Go play somewhere else!"

Oh no! Da Fei had a bad feeling.

Da Fei tried to talk to the NPCs on the island. Everyone was very unfriendly to him! They didn't sell anything, didn't give him any missions, and didn't look friendly either.

What he was most worried about happened. Did they think he was one of them only after he became a pirate? If he didn't join them, he'd be stuck on this island for the rest of his life? Was that why Loke was so confident that he'd look for him?

Impossible! This was the same as the system forcing players to change jobs. There must be a way to clear this level. He wouldn't give in. He'd find a way to get out.

At this moment, Da Fei's stamina began to increase. Hunger state. F*ck! Eating was a big problem too! Not to mention if the owner was willing to sell food to him, even if he was, he'd have nothing!

An uninhabited island was a hopeless situation. An island with people and prosperity was also a hopeless situation? He didn't believe that an expert like him, who survived all sorts of storms, would die in a toilet?

He'd start with the tavern, where there were many characters.

Taverns were very important to pirates. They were even the only entertainment venue, so there were many taverns in the town. Da Fei went inside the first place on the street.

The hustle and bustle of the bar was overwhelming. Dancer, gambler, drunkard, customer, ordinary bar. Da Fei's entry didn't attract much attention. However, the customers sitting at the single table drinking in silence did attract Da Fei's attention. They were yellow names meant for neutrality, ordinary heroes waiting to be hired by players. Heroes were easy to recognize. There was a faint halo underneath their feet. The human heroes of the Holy Church had golden halos, the Undead Heroes had green smoke halos, the Elven Heroes had golden butterflies, the Pirates had blood-red halos, etc.

There was a truth in the Hero Continent: where there were taverns, there were heroes waiting to be hired. Pirate Island was no exception. Even if players went to enemy territories, and the world was full of red-named enemies, the heroes in the taverns were still yellow-named.

These heroes would be refreshed by the system every once in a while, so whenever a hero with top-notch talent or top-notch talent was encountered, players would fight to hire them. Of course, heroes who were not of the same race and camp as players were harder to recruit.

Da Fei walked toward the first table. This was a pirate hero who stood on a blood-red light and showed off his bare chest muscles. Of course, the room was filled with pirate heroes.

Dafei greeted, "Hello!"

The hero glanced at Da Fei and snorted. "I'm not interested in playing with kindergarteners. Go away."

If he thought I was a newbie without a class change, he could change to someone else.

— "Where did you pop out from? Go away."

She thought he wasn't famous enough, so she kept changing.

— "I don't have money to make a beggar."

He could tell he didn't have enough money to eat. Next.

"The rule here is to buy a drink first, right?"

I didn't ask you for a single cent? What the heck? What am I doing? I'm not here to hire a hero, right? I already reserved an Epic Hero. I don't care if you wasted my experience. My top priority is to eat and drink.

Da Fei went toward the liquor cabinet. "Boss, do you need a job?"

The owner looked at him coldly. "I don't recruit people of dubious background."

F*ck! Trying to force someone to do something? No way! I won't give in. I'll just go to another bar. Da Fei kept going.

After seeing all the bars on the street, he suddenly felt sad. This was so similar to when he graduated and started looking for a job.

Do I have to go into the sea to fish up prawns and eat them raw? Da Fei sighed as he looked at the last two coconuts he had. I'll keep going! I won't give up until the end.

This time, Da Fei walked toward another tavern. This one wasn't as noisy as the other taverns, and the sound of the violin could be heard. What the heck, artistic pirates?

The moment Da Fei entered the room, he stood there like he was electrocuted!

A beauty! A long-haired woman in a black leather bra, black leather skirt, and black leather boots was sitting at the bar! She wasn't a bar girl! The blood-red glow under her voluptuous and muscular bronze thighs indicated she was a hero, a sexy and beautiful female pirate hero!

What the f*ck! Female heroes were rare to begin with, and beautiful heroes were even rarer. Such a sexy and wild female hero would drive other male players crazy until they died! When it came to beautiful heroes, aptitude, strengths, levels, races, and classes didn't matter anymore. Love didn't need standards!

Da Fei was a hardcore captain. He needed a deputy captain, which meant a first mate. He needed a good first mate.

As for whether it would work? This… this was a big problem. It was much harder to recruit female heroes than male heroes. Females were born with a sense of security, so they were very picky with their employers. The harder it was to find, the better. Therefore, during the Open Beta, players' passion for female heroes far exceeded their desire for so-called God-grade equipment. As long as a beautiful female hero appeared in a tavern, the place would be crowded.

My situation now is very unfavorable. If ordinary heroes don't like me, how can she like me? In that instant, Da Fei remembered Liu Dawei. How did he hook up with my sister? Hot! My sister must be too nice to refuse this poor guy!

No! He needed to be confident. He was a man with a big boat! And judging from the bar's music, she was an art thief. He needed to be artistic too.

Da Fei immediately took off the water soldier leather armor at the door and changed into a black captain's etiquette uniform. The image of a mature, handsome, and extraordinary young captain appeared! He was indeed a high-end model with a suit rating of 90 and a camouflage rating of 60. He looked different.

After that, he shouldn't act like a noob. A man who couldn't even eat his fill wanted to pick up girls? Da Fei took off the captain's hat, crushed the precious coconut, and drank it all. Oh yeah! Stamina + 100, I'm full!

Then, he took out the Captain's Sword from his bag and equipped it. When the pirates boarded the ship, Da Fei was afraid something would happen, so he put the sword in his bag.

Everything was ready. Da Fei rushed inside.

Wearing a ceremonial uniform was indeed very different. All the other customers in the bar, including the pretty girl, couldn't help looking toward the door. It was completely different from when he was like a dog in other bars, with no one around.

Wahahaha, did you see that? Only captains of high-end ships had this kind of clothes. Most boat captains were only fishermen! This was a symbol of status! Who would have thought this kind of clothes without fighting attributes could have this effect?

At this moment, Da Fei's eyes met the female pirate's! Her sexy blue eyeshadow, her fiery red lips, her shoulder-length hair that covered half of her face, her beautiful oval face, her smooth shoulders! A beauty! A beauty! Very quickly, Da Fei couldn't help but look down at her voluptuous breasts, which couldn't be hidden by the leather bra! No wonder she was a female pirate. She often bathed in the sun. Her bronze-colored healthy skin, her sexy belly button, her faintly discernible abs, her low-cut leather skirt, and the half exposed tattoo of a Blood Rose…

In that instant, Da Fei made up his mind. If he didn't kidnap this female pirate, he wouldn't leave!

Under the female pirate's surprised gaze, Da Fei walked gracefully to the bar counter next to her. He smiled and said, "Can I sit here?"

The female pirate turned and said lazily, "Maybe you should buy me something to drink first?"

— Boom!!! Da Fei's heart pounded! I can't even afford a glass of wine! This is what you call killing a hero with one dollar!

Da Fei took out the last coconut and forced a smile. "Drinking alcohol is not good for your beautiful skin and health. Coconut juice is natural."

The female pirate squinted and reached out her hand. "Give it to me!"

This worked! Da Fei was overjoyed. He quickly handed over the coconut. "I'll open it for you."

"No need!" The female pirate took the bag with both hands and left her seat at the same time. Then—under Da Fei's shocked gaze, she made the motion of a goalkeeper opening the ball with her big feet. With a bang, the coconut flew out of the window and disappeared into the sky…

"Exercise is good for health!" The female pirate clapped her hands and returned to her seat to drink as if there was no one else around. Da Fei was stunned. This was his last food! How could you do this?

Oh no, I knew it wouldn't be that easy. I can't pass the first level, no chance. But I won't give up easily, unless you tell me to get lost!

The second move was literature! Da Fei found a book of poems from the inventory of the seafarer, Juan. Hey, uncle, sorry.

Da Fei put the poem on her desk and smiled. "This poem is for you, who is as pretty as a poem!" Humph, this was his art style.

The female pirate flicked the poem back with one finger. "I don't know any words!"

— Pfft! Da Fei almost choked! If you don't know how to read, why pretend to be an artistic pirate? Why listen to a violin?

What should he do? Should he just use the ultimate move and give away the treasure?

C

"Yes."
