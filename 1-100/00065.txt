Chapter 65: Banshee Instructor

Xue Wei's female players excitedly started their last ritual. Da Fei hid in a corner, completely helpless!

Kill all of them? If he could fight six of them at once, he wouldn't hesitate to kill them! The problem was, even if he could kill them, it'd be like poking a hornet's nest! Advise them to leave? Their heads would be kicked by a donkey! A big guild and a big studio was doing a project worth millions. If he dared to show up and complain, not only would his game ID be killed, but even a real person would be killed.

What should he do? He could only hope they'd finish the job quickly and leave. But looking at how slow and hot the array was, it didn't seem like it could be fixed that quickly. The encounter was inevitable. What would the nun do if she saw them sneaking around? Would she call the police to stop their ritual? Or… would she think they were sent by her mom?

Da Fei's mind raced.

As time passed, the array became increasingly red. Every member of Xue Wei looked excited and nervous.

Right at this moment, a petite figure in a black robe appeared silently in front of the storeroom.

It's here! Da Fei's heart skipped a beat.

The petite figure stood at the door for a while before sneaking into the storeroom. Meanwhile, Xue Wei's group of silly girls was excitedly surrounding the magic circle, not knowing that someone was coming from behind! They had team members outside to keep watch, so they weren't on guard at all. What they didn't know was that the young nun had avoided their team members in order to avoid detection.

Now, the young nun stood quietly behind the crowd. The older woman had told her not to be surprised at anyone she saw at night.

Da Fei almost vomited blood again! What he didn't want to see the most had happened. Oolong! This was a big deal! The little nun must think they were here for her!

If Xue Wei swindled her and won her over, wouldn't he lose out? He had decided. Once the situation got out of control, he would rush out and tell her, "I'm the person you're looking for!" Even if he screwed up and couldn't get her, he wouldn't let them take advantage of him!

A red light flashed on the spell formation, followed by faint, seductive laughter. Xue Wei Rose shouted excitedly, "Go! This is the most crucial moment!"

Hearing the evil laughter, the young nun couldn't help but be shocked!

At this moment—"Ah!!!" The Bloodvein Sacred Spear, across from the young nun, looked up and finally noticed someone else in the room.

This was a big shock. Everyone in the Xue Wei team felt as if they had seen a ghost. "Ah!!!"

The young nun was also stunned for a moment before she said in a low voice, "Continue! Otherwise, the ritual will fail."

— Ah! Da Fei kept coughing blood! It was a mistake. Little girl, do you know what they're doing? I don't know either!

Everyone looked at each other, at a loss. They couldn't stop now. The girl gritted her teeth. "Go on!"

Everyone chuckled sheepishly at the young nun, then continued to channel their magic power into the spell formation. The enchanting laughter inside the spell formation became more boisterous. A pink smoke rose from the spell formation and gathered.

"No mana!"

The girl gritted her teeth. "Drink the blue!"

Everyone took out big blue bottles and drank them all. Da Fei, who was watching from the dark, was amazed at the amount. This was a big blue bottle worth thousands of gold coins, comparable to the price of an angel. This was indeed a big studio drinking mana like drinking water!

The smoke gathered into a transparent figure. "Not enough! Too weak! You don't even have the power to materialize me in this plane. How dare you summon me?"

The Blood Rose was shocked. "We have to materialize?"

The smoke sounded impatient. "This is the first time I've met such a weak ruler. We'll see when you're stronger. Goodbye!"

Everyone was shocked!

At this moment, the young nun made her move. "Wait! I'll help!"

Xue Wei and the others nodded repeatedly. "OK! OK!"

Da Fei was so angry he could explode! How much blood did he have left? How much tears did he have? You stupid women, did you understand the situation?

With the little nun's help, the red glow of the magic circle intensified, and the pink smoke condensed into a transparent human figure, which continued to materialize. Finally, a woman with snow-white skin, a round ass, and a stunning figure appeared! Under her waist was a pair of glistening black Devil's Wings, Banshee! A Level 4 Soldier Banshee from the Hell Race!

Wow!!! All the beauties present cried out in shock. Da Fei's eyes almost popped out of his head! No, it wasn't an ordinary female monster. Most female monsters had earth-red skin. How could they be as white as her? She didn't have hooves or tails!

With Da Fei's Grandmaster-level Reconnaissance Skill, the name of this Banshee was—Banshee Instructor!

Oh no! It was the instructor!

What kind of instructors were they? Supporting facilities for soldiers! Soldiers like the Sea Anemone King were obviously very unusual, they just needed to throw a seed. But ordinary soldiers needed a blueprint to build a training camp, and also a mercenary type instructor! Soldiers without an instructor not only had very low yields, but the soldiers they made were all in the most ordinary form. Any soldier with a special skill, "training," could be an instructor. This skill could appear randomly on any soldier, and the chance of it happening was one in a thousand. So, once a player made a soldier with a special skill in the NPC camp or their own castle, it'd be great.

Banshee was the perfect strategy for the Infernal Race, because Banshee had a godly skill—Charm!

Banshee: Attack: 6, Defense: 6, Health: 30, Damage: 6-13, Attack Speed: 9, Movement Speed: 16, Command Value: 2, Fire Resistance: 90%, Magic Resistance: 45%, Casting Speed: Instantaneous. Skill: Charm, Chain Shooting.

Charm: Banshee can charm an enemy on the battlefield, making them forget about themselves and unable to fight. Once attacked, they will regain consciousness. The Charm effect is related to the number of Banshee and the power of the hero.

Chain Shot: The Banshee is a long-range attack type. Her flame attacks will hit nearby targets. All units hit by her flame have a burning effect.

For the Infernal Race, players often used the Triangle Combination of Horse, Chicken, Dog, and Iron. The Horse was the Infernal Nightmare, the Dog was the Three-Headed Hellhound, and the Chicken was the Banshee. At the start of the game, the Banshee's Instant Charming would be able to control a unit of the enemy, usually a long-range unit that could pose a threat to the Banshee. Then, the Hell Horses and the Three-Headed Dog would charge. In short, the attacks of the Infernal Race, whether they suppressed the enemy first or used the Hell Portal to summon reinforcements, were all very powerful.

The Banshee, as a level-four CC, had a lot of tactics. The only drawback was its low HP and low defense.

Now, this bare-chested female monster instructor appeared in front of all the girls, making all the girls pale in comparison! All the girls were thinking, how could the nun summon the monster?

In the dark corner, Da Fei's * * * had reached its peak! He wanted women who wore clothes, not to mention naked women with big white buttocks! The key was, what should he do?

The demoness looked around and chuckled. "Who's my master?"

Xue Wei Rose immediately jumped out. "It's me, it's me! I summoned you!"

What the heck! Da Fei gritted his teeth so hard he almost bled! He wanted to be the owner too!

The Banshee shook her head and sneered. "You're not worthy. You can't even command me!"

The girls were shocked. "Command points? Big sis doesn't have 140 points?"

The Banshee pursed her lips. "I want the basic Command Value. The so-called Command Value of official positions in your world doesn't work on me. I don't acknowledge these official positions."

Blood Rose was shocked. "My basic Command Value isn't even 40 points? Are you a boss?"

The demoness ignored her. She winked at the young nun, then hugged her like a big sister, stroked her face, and smiled. "Are you willing to be my master?"

The little nun shivered. Everyone in Xue Wei Studio was shocked!

The Blood Rose made a prompt decision. "This… Miss Claire, please be her master. None of us have the right to command her!"

Xue Wei Rose's plan was, of course, to get this Heroic nun to recruit this Boss-level soldier, and then, the next step would be to gather the entire studio to recruit this Heroic nun! It was killing two birds with one stone!

The young nun hesitated. "But…"

Everyone tried to persuade her. "Miss Claire!"

The young nun came tonight with great determination. She was prepared for anything that went against the rules, so she nodded. "OK!"

The demoness chuckled. "Greetings, my master. Deirdre is at your service!"

The girls all clapped. "Miss Claire is amazing!"

At this moment, a member of the lookout team appeared. "Here to do ward rounds!"

Xue Wei and the others immediately said, "Miss Claire, see you tomorrow!" They ran out of the storeroom.

The young nun was completely stunned. "Hey! You—"

Wahahaha! This is a golden opportunity! God, you didn't abandon me! I can still cry!

— "Serbia!"

The young nun was startled and looked back. "Who is it?"

"We agreed during the day not to be surprised at anything."

Ah? Under the nun's shocked gaze, Da Fei, in his captain's uniform, slowly walked out of the corner.
